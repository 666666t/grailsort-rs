# An implementation of Grail Sort using Rust

In conjunction with the Grail Sort Rewrite project organized by the Musicombo Discord server, this repository seeks to contain a reorganized reference implementation of Andrey Astrelin's Grail Sort using the Rust Programming Language.

Grail Sort is a form of Block Merge Sort, Featuring O(n log n) sorting complexity while retaining both Stability and O(1) extra space requirements. The main repository for the project can be found at https://github.com/MusicTheorist/Rewritten-Grailsort, including numerous other implementations and details relating to the project.
